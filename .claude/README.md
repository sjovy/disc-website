# .claude/ Directory

**DO NOT DELETE THIS DIRECTORY OR ITS CONTENTS**

This directory contains essential project infrastructure:

- **agents/** - Agent definitions and capabilities
- **skills/** - Reusable workflow patterns
- **CLAUDE.md** - Project-specific instructions (created during planning)
- **README.md** - This file

## For New Projects

When copying .claude/ to a new project:
1. Copy entire directory structure
2. Keep agents/ and skills/ intact
3. Clear CLAUDE.md (project-specific, will be populated during planning)
4. Keep this README.md

## Protection Rule

When setting up projects or initializing tooling, explicitly preserve .claude/:
- Do not clear it
- Do not overwrite it
- Do not delete agents/ or skills/

These files are required for proper PM orchestrator operation.
