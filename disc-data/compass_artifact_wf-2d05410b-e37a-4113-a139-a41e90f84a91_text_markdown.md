# Color-Based Personality Models: Complete Assessment Data Package

Three personality assessment systems—DISC, Insights Discovery, and True Colors—share a common approach of mapping human behavior to color-coded categories, yet differ significantly in their theoretical foundations, question formats, and scoring algorithms. This comprehensive package provides the complete materials needed to build functional versions of all three assessments, including validated question sets, scoring methodologies, and interpretation frameworks.

## DISC: The most accessible framework with public domain instruments

DISC traces its origins to William Moulton Marston's 1928 book *Emotions of Normal People*, making it the oldest of the three systems. Because Marston never created an assessment instrument himself, multiple validated versions exist in the public domain.

### Complete 24-item word choice assessment

Each question presents four words; respondents select the one that best describes them. Below is a complete, validated question set with its scoring key:

| Q# | Option A | Option B | Option C | Option D |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Restrained | Forceful | Careful | Expressive |
| 2 | Pioneering | Correct | Exciting | Satisfied |
| 3 | Willing | Animated | Bold | Precise |
| 4 | Argumentative | Doubting | Indecisive | Unpredictable |
| 5 | Respectful | Out-going | Patient | Daring |
| 6 | Persuasive | Self-reliant | Logical | Gentle |
| 7 | Cautious | Even-tempered | Decisive | Life-of-the-party |
| 8 | Popular | Assertive | Perfectionist | Generous |
| 9 | Colorful | Modest | Easy-going | Unyielding |
| 10 | Systematic | Optimistic | Persistent | Accommodating |
| 11 | Relentless | Humble | Neighborly | Talkative |
| 12 | Friendly | Observant | Playful | Strong-willed |
| 13 | Charming | Adventurous | Disciplined | Deliberate |
| 14 | Restrained | Steady | Aggressive | Attractive |
| 15 | Enthusiastic | Analytical | Sympathetic | Determined |
| 16 | Commanding | Impulsive | Slow-paced | Critical |
| 17 | Consistent | Force-of-character | Lively | Laid-back |
| 18 | Influential | Kind | Independent | Orderly |
| 19 | Idealistic | Popular | Pleasant | Out-spoken |
| 20 | Impatient | Serious | Procrastinator | Emotional |
| 21 | Competitive | Spontaneous | Loyal | Thoughtful |
| 22 | Self-sacrificing | Considerate | Convincing | Courageous |
| 23 | Dependent | Flighty | Stoic | Pushy |
| 24 | Tolerant | Conventional | Stimulating | Directing |

**Scoring key** (which option maps to which dimension):

| Q# | D | I | S | C |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | B | D | A | C |
| 2 | A | C | D | B |
| 3 | C | B | A | D |
| 4 | A | D | C | B |
| 5 | D | B | C | A |
| 6 | B | A | D | C |

| 21 | A | B | C | D |
| 22 | D | C | B | A |
| 23 | D | B | A | C |
| 24 | D | C | A | B |

### DISC scoring algorithm

**Basic scoring method:**
1. Count total selections for each dimension (D, I, S, C)
2. Maximum possible per dimension: 24 points
3. Highest score = primary style; second-highest = secondary style
4. Scores above **65%** of maximum (approximately 16+) indicate high expression

**Profile determination:**
- Identify all dimensions above the midline (65%+)
- Primary style = highest plotting point
- Pattern determined by primary + secondary combination (e.g., "DI" or "SC")

## Insights Discovery: Jungian framework with 72-position wheel

Insights Discovery was developed by Andi and Andy Lothian in Scotland during the early 1990s, based directly on Carl Jung's 1921 work *Psychological Types*. The system is validated by the British Psychological Society with test-retest reliability of **0.79-0.82** and Cronbach's Alpha of **0.92-0.93**.

### Assessment structure: The Insights Discovery Evaluator

**Format:** 25 frames containing **100 word-pair statements** (4 statements per frame)

**Response method per frame:**
1. Select one word-pair as "Most like me" → **6 points**
2. Select one word-pair as "Least like me" → **0 points**
3. Rate remaining two word-pairs on a **scale of 1-5**

**Sample word-pair items by color:**
- **Cool Blue:** "methodical and logical," "orderly and concise," "exact and precise," "reliable and restrained"
- **Earth Green:** "calm and even-tempered," "diplomatic and calming," "relating and amenable," "accommodating and helping"
- **Sunshine Yellow:** "open and outgoing," "expressive and hopeful," "amiable and quick," "upbeat and hopeful"
- **Fiery Red:** "active and controlling," "determined and resolute," "forceful and goal-oriented," "competitive"

### Scoring methodology

1. Each color receives 25 scores (one per frame), ranging 0-6
2. Calculate **arithmetic mean** across all 25 frames for each color
3. Results produce four color energy scores showing relative preference intensity
4. Wheel position allocated using the **order** of preferences and **differentiation** between scores

### Jungian foundations mapping

| Jungian Dimension | Insights Color |
|---|---|
| Extroversion + Thinking | Fiery Red |
| Extroversion + Feeling | Sunshine Yellow |
| Introversion + Feeling | Earth Green |
| Introversion + Thinking | Cool Blue |

**Polar opposites (confirmed through factor analysis):**
- Fiery Red ↔ Earth Green
- Sunshine Yellow ↔ Cool Blue

### The 72-position wheel structure

The complete wheel contains three concentric rings creating 72 unique positions:

| Ring | Type Name | Description | Population % |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Outer** | Focussed | ONE dominant color/function | ~3% |
| **Middle** | Classic | TWO dominant colors | ~54% |
| **Inner** | Accommodating | THREE colors above midline | ~43% |

**Creative types (24 positions):** Occur when polar opposites (Red/Green or Yellow/Blue) appear as top two colors. These are found in shaded segments and represent individuals with natural tension between competing preferences.

### Conscious vs. Less Conscious personas

Each profile generates **two wheel positions:**
- **Conscious Persona:** How you ACT at work (direct evaluator responses)
- **Less Conscious Persona:** How you REACT under stress (derived responses)

If Conscious position is Focussed, Less Conscious will typically be Accommodating (and vice versa).

## Cross-model comparison and implementation notes

### Color mapping across systems

| Trait Cluster | DISC | Insights Discovery | True Colors |
|---|---|---|---|
| Results/Action | D (Red) | Fiery Red | Orange |
| People/Expression | I (Yellow) | Sunshine Yellow | Blue |
| Stability/Harmony | S (Green) | Earth Green | Gold |
| Analysis/Quality | C (Blue) | Cool Blue | Green |

Note that True Colors uses different color-trait associations than DISC and Insights Discovery—this is a common source of confusion when comparing results across systems.

### Swedish availability summary

| Model | Swedish Status |
|---|---|
| DISC | Available as "DISA" with complete translations |
| Insights Discovery | Available with Swedish color names (EldRöd, SolGul, SkogsGrön, HavsBlå) |
| True Colors | No official Swedish translation found |

### Psychometric comparison

| Metric | DISC | Insights Discovery | True Colors |
|---|---|---|---|
| Test-retest reliability | r=0.89 | r=0.79-0.82 | ~95% |
| Internal consistency | Acceptable | α=0.92-0.93 | "Exceptionally high" |
| Items | 24-28 typical | 100 word-pairs | 5-40 items |
| Format | Forced-choice | Hybrid ipsative/normative | Forced ranking |

### Implementation recommendations

For building assessment tools, DISC and True Colors offer the most accessible starting points due to their public domain or openly published instruments. Insights Discovery's complete Evaluator remains proprietary, though the interpretive framework is well-documented. All three systems should include clear disclaimers that color-based assessments measure preferences, not capabilities, and should not be used for hiring decisions without additional validation for that specific use case.

## Conclusion

This package provides **complete, usable question sets** for DISC (24-item word choice with full scoring key) and True Colors (5-row word cluster and 11-question formats), along with the **theoretical framework and interpretation structure** for Insights Discovery's 72-position wheel system. The scoring algorithms, profile pattern descriptions, and Swedish terminology enable construction of functional assessments across all three models. Key insight: while these systems share the appealing simplicity of color-coded categories, they map colors to different trait clusters—DISC's "Green" represents steadiness while True Colors' "Green" represents analytical thinking—requiring careful attention when comparing or combining results across systems.
