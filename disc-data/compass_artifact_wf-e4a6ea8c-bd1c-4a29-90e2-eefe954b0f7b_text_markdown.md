# The 15 Classical DISC Profile Patterns: Complete Reference

The 15 classical DISC profile patterns represent the foundational behavioral archetypes identified by Walter Clarke in the 1950s–60s and enriched by **John Geier through clinical interviews** with hundreds of subjects in the 1970s at the University of Minnesota. Geier's Personal Profile System (PPS), now published by Wiley as DiSC Classic 2.0, maps **2,041 possible score combinations** onto these 15 patterns based on which of the four DISC dimensions plot above or below a midline on a 7-segment scale. Four patterns are "pure" (single dimension above midline), nine are two-dimension combinations, and two are complex three-dimension patterns. This document provides the complete behavioral specification for each pattern across all 12 required dimensions.

The theoretical foundation traces to William Moulton Marston's 1928 work *Emotions of Normal People*, which proposed four primary behavioral dimensions: Dominance, Inducement, Submission, and Compliance. Clarke built the first DISC assessment instrument (the Activity Vector Analysis) in the late 1940s, and factor analysis of his data revealed patterns mapping directly to Marston's model. Geier's contribution was not instrument development but rather **collecting rich behavioral descriptions through systematic clinical interviews**, producing the narrative profiles that became the Classical Profile Patterns. Validation studies show median coefficient alpha of **.87** (internal consistency) and median test-retest reliability of **.86**, with **90% of respondents agreeing** with their narrative pattern descriptions.

## How the 15 patterns are determined from scores

Each respondent receives a four-digit segment number (one per DISC dimension, ranging 1–7) plotted on a graph with a midline at segment 4. The pattern is determined by which dimensions plot above the midline and their relative intensities:

- **Pure styles** (1 dimension above midline): Developer, Promoter, Specialist, Objective Thinker
- **Two-dimension combinations**: Results-Oriented (D>I), Inspirational (D≈I), Creative (D+C), Persuader (I>D), Counselor (I+S), Appraiser (I+C), Agent (S+I), Achiever (S+D), Perfectionist (C+S)
- **Three-dimension combinations**: Investigator (S+D+C), Practitioner (C+I+S)

For patterns sharing the same primary/secondary dimensions (e.g., Results-Oriented vs. Inspirational), the relative distance between scores determines which pattern applies.

## DOMINANCE FAMILY (High D Primary)

The four D-family patterns share a drive to shape the environment by overcoming opposition. They are task-oriented, fast-paced, and focused on results. The secondary dimension creates critically different behavioral flavors.

### Pattern 1 — Developer (Pure D)

**DISC Combination:** D high (only dimension above midline); I, S, C all low

**Alternative Names:** Pure D, High D, Dominant, Commander, Driver, Conductor

**Behavioral Description**

Developers are self-reliant individuals who seek their own creative and individualistic solutions to problems. Strong-willed and free from constraining influences, they are most interested in opportunities for advancement and accomplishing self-set goals. A challenge to them is "like meat to a lion." They use direct, forceful behavior and persist through whatever hurdles stand between them and success. They have **high expectations of themselves and others** and become critical when standards are not met. Their intense focus on results can make them seem impatient and uncaring.

Developers shape their environment by overcoming opposition and are primarily interested in personal needs and wants. They view situations through a lens of operational efficiency, navigate through remarkable boldness, and tolerate minimal delay or emotional obstacles. They look at the big picture, identify next best steps, and delegate day-to-day tasks. They operate well as self-starters who enjoy taking risks. As the purest D pattern, the Developer is not tempered by any secondary dimension — what you see is what you get.

Their emotions are driven by anger and impatience when things move too slowly or when they lose control. Of all 15 patterns, the Developer is the most singularly focused on personal control and independent problem-solving. Their primary team value is as an **innovative problem solver** — the buck stops with them.

**Core Strengths:** Innovative problem-solving; self-reliance and independence; direct and decisive action; persistence through obstacles; big-picture thinking; confidence under pressure; natural risk-taking; strong-willed drive

**Weaknesses and Blind Spots:** Attempts to control people and situations; impatient and uncaring appearance; critical when standards unmet; forgets to include others in problem-solving; forceful manner intimidates; announces decisions without explaining reasoning; lacks tact, diplomacy, and patience

**Communication Style:** Direct, blunt, bottom-line oriented. Prefers brief exchanges with minimal small talk. Dislikes repeating information or generalizations. Focuses narrowly on solutions, not problems. Values efficiency above all in communication — hates wasted time.

**Work Environment:** Needs variety of challenges and room for independence. Dislikes routine work. Prefers fast-paced, results-driven settings with opportunities for advancement and freedom to shape their own approach.

**Leadership Style:** Commanding and decisive. Takes charge naturally, makes quick decisions, provides clarity during uncertainty. Excels in crisis situations where speed is essential. May bulldoze team input and move too quickly without bringing others along.

**Stress Triggers:** Loss of control; loss of new opportunities; being limited or micromanaged; indecision in others; routine; slow progress. **Under stress:** Becomes belligerent, impatient, harsh, and may monopolize conversations or railroad decisions.

**Motivation Drivers:** Challenge and new opportunities; achievement; control over environment; independence and autonomy; power, winning, and variety

**Decision-Making:** Quick and decisive — acts immediately and adjusts later rather than analyzing extensively. Views time as a critical asset. "Let's stop overanalyzing."

**Conflict Style:** Head-on. Addresses issues quickly and decisively. Direct and assertive. May assert views so strongly others feel pressured into agreement. Competitive approach creates win/lose dynamics. Respects equally direct opponents.

---

### Pattern 2 — Results-Oriented (D/I)

**DISC Combination:** D high (primary); I moderate-high (secondary above midline); S and C low

**Alternative Names:** Result-Oriented, Di style, Driver-Influencer, Bold Achiever

**Behavioral Description**

Results-Oriented individuals seek to accomplish results above all else. They value independence and display a self-confidence that some perceive as arrogance. Competitive by nature, they gravitate toward difficult tasks and high positions. They exude a sense of self-importance and display visible self-satisfaction when completing responsibilities. Routine work makes them impatient.

Their forceful and direct manner may create challenges with co-workers. They make **value judgments based on others' ability to get results** and are critical of those who are not as quick-thinking as they are. They are persistent and determined even in the face of antagonism. The key distinction from the Developer is that the I secondary gives them more social awareness, though they primarily channel this social energy toward driving results rather than building relationships for their own sake. They display "high ego strength and rugged individualism."

Results-Oriented people are diligent and influence others through force of character. Their competitiveness creates energy but can also create win/lose dynamics. They need to practice patience, show concern, and develop genuine interest in others to maximize effectiveness. They would benefit from getting opinions and suggestions from co-workers rather than relying solely on their own judgment.

**Core Strengths:** Persistence and determination (primary team value); high ego strength; competitive drive; self-confidence and decisiveness; diligence; ability to influence through force of character; independence; thrives on difficult tasks

**Weaknesses and Blind Spots:** Competitive behaviors creating win/lose; self-confidence perceived as arrogance; critical of slower thinkers; forceful manner creates co-worker friction; impatient with routine; blunt and uncaring; makes judgments solely on results capability

**Communication Style:** Direct and forceful. High confidence in self-expression. Values efficiency. More socially aware than the Developer due to I secondary but uses charm strategically for results. Critical and fault-finding when displeased.

**Work Environment:** High positions with independence and control. Competitive environments with difficult, challenging tasks. Freedom from routine. Results-driven culture valuing measurable accomplishment and recognition.

**Leadership Style:** Leads with determination and force of character. Sets high standards. Creates competitive dynamics. Most effective when channeling the I secondary — practicing patience, showing concern, and soliciting team input.

**Stress Triggers:** Routine work; slow-thinking colleagues; loss of control or independence. **Under stress:** Becomes fault-finding, critical, oversteps boundaries. Competitive behaviors escalate.

**Motivation Drivers:** Control, dominance, and independence; difficult tasks and high positions; accomplishing visible results; self-satisfaction from achievement; competition and winning

**Decision-Making:** Quick and decisive. Judges decisions by whether they produce results. Would benefit from slowing down to think through consequences.

**Conflict Style:** Directly confrontational. Persistent even facing antagonism. Blunt and uncaring in disputes. Creates win/lose through competition. Critical and fault-finding when stressed.

**Key Distinction from Developer:** The I secondary provides more social leverage and awareness of others' perceptions, but this energy is channeled instrumentally toward results rather than relationships. The Developer is more purely self-reliant; the Results-Oriented person uses social force of character as a tool.

---

### Pattern 3 — Inspirational (D≈I)

**DISC Combination:** D high (primary, slightly above I); I high (nearly equal to D, both above midline); S and C low

**Alternative Names:** Di blend (equal), Motivator, Mover-and-Shaker, Charismatic Leader

**Behavioral Description**

Inspirational individuals influence the thoughts and actions of others, directing behavior toward predetermined goals. The defining characteristic of this pattern is that **D and I are nearly equal** — the I is "not much lower than the D." This near-equality produces a fundamentally different behavioral approach from either the Developer or Results-Oriented patterns: Inspirational people prefer to work with others through **cooperation and persuasion rather than domination**.

They have clear results in mind and can be charming in interactions. They offer others what they want and need — such as power, security, or recognition — strategically to meet their own objectives. People experience conflicting emotions around Inspirational types: a push-pull sensation of being drawn to their charisma yet wary of their agenda. They minimize needs for affection and approval and accept aggression as part of the landscape.

They are the quintessential "movers and shakers" who initiate action and demand results. Their strategic use of rewards, charm, and — when needed — intimidation makes them powerful coalition builders. They judge others by social status and personal strength. They need fun and variety to keep energy high, resist systematic detailed work, and can become manipulative or belligerent when their influence is threatened.

**Core Strengths:** Powerful influence over others' thoughts and actions; charming and persuasive; works through cooperation; directs behavior toward predetermined goals; strategic coalition building; natural charisma; initiates action as a "mover and shaker"

**Weaknesses and Blind Spots:** "Ends justify the means" attitude; manipulative tendencies under stress; instrumental use of charm; push-pull dynamics with others; resists detailed analytical work; may not share credit; judges others by status and strength; can be elitist

**Communication Style:** Persuasive and charming. Alternates between cooperation and domination. Offers people what they need to gain cooperation. More socially sophisticated than Developer or Results-Oriented. Uses emotional appeals strategically.

**Work Environment:** Needs fun and variety. Frequent change desirable. Resists systematic, detailed work. Wants control of environment and objectives. Positions with visible social status and authority.

**Leadership Style:** Leads through influence and persuasion rather than pure domination. Charismatic and inspirational. Sets predetermined goals and directs behavior toward them. Strategic — offers followers what they need in exchange for support. Most effective when making others feel success is shared.

**Stress Triggers:** Loss of social status; appearing weak; inability to influence others; environments requiring detailed work. **Under stress:** Becomes manipulative, belligerent, or quarrelsome. "Ends justify the means" thinking intensifies.

**Motivation Drivers:** Control of environment and objectives; social status and position; being seen as strong and influential; achievement of predetermined goals; power and authority

**Decision-Making:** Decisive with clear results in mind. More collaborative than Developer or Results-Oriented — considers how to bring others along. Still driven by own objectives but frames decisions to appeal to others.

**Conflict Style:** Combination of charm and force. May alternate between persuasion and intimidation. Can become manipulative. Creates push-pull dynamics. Prefers winning through influence; resorts to aggression when charm fails.

**Key Distinction from Results-Oriented:** The near-equality of D and I creates a fundamentally different approach. Results-Oriented people use force of character; Inspirational people use persuasion and coalition-building. The Inspirational pattern is more socially strategic and charisma-driven.

---

### Pattern 4 — Creative (D/C)

**DISC Combination:** D high (primary); C high (secondary); I and S low

**Alternative Names:** DC style, Resolute, Driver-Analyst, Architect

**Behavioral Description**

The Creative pattern expresses **opposing behavioral forces**. These individuals desire immediate results (D) yet have an equally strong desire for perfection (C). You observe aggression tempered by sensitivity, quick thinking balanced by thorough option exploration. This internal tension between "act fast" and "be precise" produces both excellence and personal conflict.

Creative individuals exhibit great planning ability and strive for perfection. They make sound decisions yet may lack attention to interpersonal relationships. **Daily decisions come easily, but they exercise extreme caution on major decisions** — weighing pros and cons carefully. They can appear cool, aloof, or blunt. The D-inspired bluntness combined with C-inspired pickiness adds stress to their workplace.

They want the freedom to explore and the authority to test and re-test findings. Their high expectations can make them too demanding of themselves and others. As leaders, Wiley describes them as exhibiting **"Resolute Leadership"** — highly determined and persistent, with inner strength that gives people courage during hard times. They are natural skeptics who show disdain for weakness and incompetence, set high standards, spot inefficiencies, and have a "fighting spirit."

They are uniquely positioned as change agents because they combine the drive to push for results with the analytical rigor to ensure quality. Both D and C sit on the skeptical/questioning side of the DISC model, making this pattern the most questioning and challenging of all 15.

**Core Strengths:** Positive change agent (primary team value); innovative approaches combined with systematic development; great planning ability; sound decision-making; explores all options; strategic vision with analytical precision; identifies weaknesses proactively; separates feelings from issues; high standards

**Weaknesses and Blind Spots:** Demeaning, condescending attitudes; lacks interpersonal attention; appears cool, aloof, blunt; D-bluntness + C-pickiness stresses co-workers; too demanding of self and others; prefers not to share control; sulks when stressed; shows disdain for incompetence; private and restrained

**Communication Style:** Private and restrained. Direct and blunt without softening messages. More comfortable with important messages in writing (C influence). Expects logic and supporting data from others. Should offer explanations of reasoning to gain cooperation.

**Work Environment:** Freedom to explore and authority to test findings. Values both innovation and quality. Dislikes routine. Wants unique accomplishments. Needs independence but demands high standards. Prefers challenging goals with freedom to plan approach.

**Leadership Style:** Resolute Leadership — determined, persistent, gives courage during hard times. Natural skeptics. Sets high standards. Spots inefficiencies. Has "fighting spirit." Creates rules and processes. May encourage too much research when action is needed. Might ignore emotional impact of logically sound decisions.

**Stress Triggers:** Failure to accomplish goals; lack of influence; routine; having to share control; incompetence in others. **Under stress:** Becomes independent and bored. **Sulks.** Withdraws. Internal D/C conflict intensifies. Becomes more blunt and critical.

**Motivation Drivers:** Unique accomplishments; innovation and being a change agent; freedom to explore; developing systems; high standards and excellence; challenging goals with systematic planning; authority and influence

**Decision-Making:** Signature dual approach — daily/routine decisions are quick and easy (D leads), while major/significant decisions involve extreme caution (C leads). Weighs pros and cons. Explores all options before committing on important matters.

**Conflict Style:** Faces issues head-on and seeks them out proactively. Uses logic and facts rather than emotions. May become blunt and demeaning toward perceived incompetence. Won't yield easily — fighting spirit. May sulk or withdraw rather than engage emotionally.

**Key Distinction from Developer:** The Developer ignores details and acts on instinct; the Creative demands precision and perfection. The internal D/C tension creates a qualitatively different decision-making and behavioral pattern — systematic where the Developer is impulsive, precise where the Developer is broad.

## INFLUENCE FAMILY (High I Primary)

The four I-family patterns share social orientation, enthusiasm, and relationship focus. They are people-oriented, expressive, and value interaction. The secondary dimension creates distinct behavioral signatures — from pure social energy (Promoter) to the rare analytical-social blend (Appraiser).

---

### Pattern 5 — Promoter (Pure I)

**DISC Combination:** I high (only dimension above midline); D, S, C all low

**Alternative Names:** Pure I, The Motivator, Enthusiast, Influencer, Entertainer, Socializer

**Behavioral Description**

Promoters are the quintessential people persons. Social and gregarious, they cast a large net of friends and colleagues and are exceptional at maintaining contact with their network. They are verbally skilled, generous with support for others' projects, and their extensive network provides resources for their own initiatives in return. They are **more interested in interaction than accomplishment**.

Promoters thrive at social events and are expressive in meetings, committees, and conferences. They perceive others in a favorable light without researching all facts, rarely antagonize intentionally, and seek favorable social environments. Their personality radiates enthusiasm, spontaneity, openness, optimism, warmth, and expressiveness. They possess a magnetic quality — walking into a room of strangers feels like an opportunity, not a challenge.

Their decision-making is intuitive and gut-driven rather than fact-based. They actively seek social situations and draw energy from them. They notice when someone feels left out and go out of their way to include them. Their warmth is authentic, which is why people trust them quickly. As a pure style, the Promoter is not modulated by any secondary dimension — the social orientation is undiluted.

**Core Strengths:** Exceptional networking; relieves tension and promotes projects; verbal persuasiveness; creates enthusiasm; brings levity and energy; facilitates brainstorming; makes favorable impressions instantly; reads emotional cues others miss; quickly improvises

**Weaknesses and Blind Spots:** Overuses praise, optimism, enthusiasm; significant time management challenges; continues socializing when tasks need attention; overestimates others' abilities; leaps to favorable conclusions without facts; disorganized under pressure; struggles with follow-through; avoids decisions risking disapproval

**Communication Style:** Expressive, animated, casual, friendly. Prefers face-to-face over written communication. Uses stories, humor, and personal anecdotes. Appreciates when others match their energy. Wants flexible agendas with personal connection before business. Sensitive to criticism — needs positive feedback before areas for improvement.

**Work Environment:** Popularity and social recognition; freedom of expression; group activities; democratic relationships; freedom from control and detail; opportunities to verbalize proposals; favorable, friendly working conditions; variety and collaboration

**Leadership Style:** Leads through charm, charisma, and enthusiasm. Creates interactive, positive environments. Natural team-builder. Diffuses conflict using humor. Extremely persuasive. May take hands-off approach risking being seen as unresponsive. Places too much trust in others. Needs to be firmer with deadlines and accountability.

**Stress Triggers:** Social rejection; isolation; exclusion from events; being pushed to be thorough; rigid routines; working alone. **Under stress:** Becomes careless, sentimental, disorganized, scattered.

**Motivation Drivers:** Social acceptance and popularity; approval; new adventures; interacting with diverse groups; open, flexible schedules; thinking on their feet; bouncing between ideas

**Decision-Making:** Intuitive and fast — gut feel over facts. Makes favorable assumptions without complete information. Tends to overestimate outcomes. Needs others who supply facts, data, and systematic approaches.

**Conflict Style:** Avoids conflict, hoping problems resolve. Uses humor to deflect. Prefers keeping things light. May smooth over without genuine resolution. Risk of personal attacks or talking over others when escalated.

---

### Pattern 6 — Persuader (I/D)

**DISC Combination:** I high (primary); D moderate-high (secondary); S and C low

**Alternative Names:** iD style, The Influencer, Motivator, Enthusiast, Change Agent

**Behavioral Description**

Persuaders love working with and through people to accomplish their own objectives. Their outgoing and persuasive personalities easily gain support and respect. They impress others and sell themselves using "winning ways." What sets them apart from Promoters is the addition of **Dominance energy** — they don't just socialize, they socialize with purpose and drive.

Persuaders prefer environments providing mobility, challenging assignments, and variety. They like to look good. Their positive outlook causes them to be too optimistic about work habits and others' potential. They overestimate their ability to change others' behavior. They are the **most impulsive and persuasive of all I styles** — fast-paced, active, charming, passionate, charismatic, bold, comfortable improvising, ambitious, self-promoting, and adventurous.

They have strong self-motivation to set and achieve objectives. They are people-oriented yet determined, combining I warmth with D drive. They are direct, positive, and optimistic and prefer to be measured by results. They desire freedom of expression and freedom from boring tasks.

**Core Strengths:** Sells and closes; poised and confident; verbal adeptness; gains respect across personality types; impresses thoughts on others; retains clients through charm; trusts intuition; engages with stories and charisma; brings people together; independent, persistent, decisive

**Weaknesses and Blind Spots:** Overuses enthusiasm, selling, and optimism; talks too much; too optimistic about results; overestimates ability to change others; gut-level approach needs more detail attention; impulsive; pursues multiple ideas without follow-through; self-promoting may alienate analytical colleagues

**Communication Style:** Fast-paced, enthusiastic, animated, persuasive. Uses friendly, open manner. Judges others by flexibility and expressiveness. Engages with stories and high-level ideas. Discusses future possibilities rather than past details. More direct than Promoter due to D influence.

**Work Environment:** Working with people; challenging assignments; variety and mobility; opportunities for status and prestige; freedom from routine; fast-paced with new opportunities; brainstorming sessions

**Leadership Style:** Leads through enthusiasm and personal charm. Generates excitement for challenging goals. Bold and impulsive. Thrives in fast-paced or unconventional settings. Combines ownership of results with natural charisma. More results-driven than Promoter.

**Stress Triggers:** Fixed environment; complex relationships; lack of variety; boring tasks; strict routines. **Under stress:** Becomes indecisive and easily persuaded; organizes to "look good" rather than genuinely; becomes scattered.

**Motivation Drivers:** Status, prestige, and authority; new opportunities; diverse interactions; fostering relationships; exploring multiple ideas; group discussions; challenging assignments with visible outcomes

**Decision-Making:** Intuitive and fast, trusts gut instinct. Once alerted to importance of details, can use analytical data effectively. Benefits from systematic data, planning, and risk-management built into processes.

**Conflict Style:** Uses direct approach with proposed solutions. More willing to confront than Promoter due to D influence. Can become impatient during prolonged discussions. Combines persuasive charm with directness. May try to "win" through force of personality.

**Key Distinction from Promoter:** The D secondary adds drive, directness, and results-orientation. Promoters socialize for socializing's sake; Persuaders socialize with purpose and ambition. Persuaders are more assertive, more impulsive, and more focused on measurable outcomes.

---

### Pattern 7 — Counselor (I/S)

**DISC Combination:** I high (primary); S moderate-high (secondary); D and C low

**Alternative Names:** iS style, The Encourager, Coach, Harmonizer, Supporter, Open style

**Behavioral Description**

Counselors embrace others with warmth, empathy, and understanding. They are long-term relationship builders, good listeners, and effective problem-solvers who use an indirect approach. They **put people first**, providing recognition and attributing less importance to task accomplishment.

Influence and Steadiness are both communicative dimensions oriented toward feelings and emotions rather than hard facts. In combination, they describe a person oriented toward personal matters and understanding others. **Of all DISC profiles, Counselors are probably the most effective at relating to other people in an all-round sense.** They socialize easily and feel at ease with strangers. They are persuasive and charming, but the Steadiness element allows them to adopt a more open, relaxed approach — becoming less directly active and more receptive to others' ideas and feelings.

Counselors have an inner need to develop and maintain friendships at work and at play. They tend to be overly tolerant. When in authority, they like to be appreciated for their contribution. They are calm, sincere, and loyal. Their sub-traits include friendliness, self-confidence, patience, and persistence.

**Core Strengths:** Exceptional listening skills and empathy; stability and predictability; building deep long-term relationships; effective problem-solving through understanding; "open door" availability; developing wide friendships; creating harmony; patient and calming presence; teaching, coaching, advising

**Weaknesses and Blind Spots:** Overuses tolerance and indirect approach; overly tolerant of non-producers; difficulty confronting performance problems; indirect when issuing orders or disciplining; takes criticism personally; too trusting; difficulty with assertiveness and saying "no"; may enable poor performers; "low profile" perceived as lacking toughness

**Communication Style:** Shows kindness, empathy, and understanding. Lets others initiate action. Interested in meeting people. Usually calm and controlled. Uses indirect, gentle approach. Influences through sincere personal relationships and availability. Provides verbal encouragement. Avoids criticism and confrontation.

**Work Environment:** Collaborative, harmonious environments; friendship and peaceful surroundings; appreciation and recognition; stability and predictability; team-oriented with close working relationships; minimal conflict; opportunities to coach and develop others

**Leadership Style:** Friendly and collaborative. Creates warm, inclusive environments with strong team cohesion. May avoid necessary conflict. Provides adequate recognition. Leads by example of care and empathy. Prefers consensus-building over directive leadership. Difficulty making tough decisions or giving critical feedback.

**Stress Triggers:** Pressuring people; being accused of causing harm; dissension and conflict; being disliked; aggressive environments; confrontation. **Under stress:** Becomes overly flexible and intimate; too trusting without differentiating; may use key friendships to influence outcomes.

**Motivation Drivers:** Collaboration, friendship, and peaceful environment; appreciation and recognition; feeling respected and liked; understanding human impact of decisions; teaching and coaching; group brainstorming

**Decision-Making:** People-focused — considers human impact above all. Indirect and consensus-seeking. Difficulty making unpopular decisions. Prefers gathering input. Avoids decisions that might harm people. Benefits from external structure and deadlines.

**Conflict Style:** Strongly conflict-averse. Uses indirect approach. Approaches calmly and privately. Acknowledges feelings first. Focuses on solutions not blame. May tolerate negative situations rather than confronting. Will mediate between others. Takes criticism personally but responds well to gentle feedback.

---

### Pattern 8 — Appraiser (I/C)

**DISC Combination:** I high (primary); C moderate-high (secondary); D and S low

**Alternative Names:** Elevated IC Pattern, Assessor, Evaluator (non-Wiley systems)

**Behavioral Description**

The Appraiser is one of the rarest classical patterns because I and C are **theoretically opposite dimensions** on the DISC model — I is accepting/people-focused/fast-paced while C is questioning/logic-focused/moderate-paced. People with Appraiser patterns have the **shortest average distance from the center** of the Everything DiSC circle, reflecting this internal tension.

Appraisers tend to be strong communicators: C's measure words carefully while I's are naturally skilled at influencing others. This produces someone both socially engaging and analytically precise — a rare and valuable combination. They are perceived as assertive rather than aggressive, elicit cooperation through consideration, and use persuasion to involve others. They are creative, direct, and accomplish results practically by developing detailed plans of action.

The hallmark of this profile is that **the individual may exhibit either influencing or compliance behaviors depending on the situation**. The two factors constantly compete for behavioral "governorship." In social/trusting environments, the I side emerges; in structured/formal settings, the C side dominates. They have a strong drive to be successful and appear accomplished — reaching goals is important, but they want **success with flair and triumph with style**.

They are critical thinkers who draw up detailed action plans, focus on methods and procedures, and prefer orderly progress. Yet they appreciate original thinking and want grand ideas to lead to concrete results. They frequently judge others by ability to initiate activities and may encourage friendly rivalry.

**Core Strengths:** Strong communication blending measured words with natural influence; accomplishes goals with teams; creative ideas serving practical purposes; assertive without aggression; elicits cooperation through consideration; develops detailed action plans; good critical thinking; verbal adeptness combined with analytical precision; competitive but considerate

**Weaknesses and Blind Spots:** Overuses authority and ingenuity; unpredictable behavior confuses colleagues (flips between I and C modes); under stress becomes critical, restless, impatient; may become authoritarian or caustic; doesn't display empathy when expressing disapproval; dislikes follow-through; eagerness to win overrides social graces; engages in bursts rather than steady pace; fears failure and disapproval

**Communication Style:** Strong verbal communicators who measure words carefully. Assertive but considerate tone. Uses persuasion and involvement rather than commands. Explains rationale to elicit cooperation. In social situations: friendly, animated, engaging. In formal situations: more blunt, plain-speaking, driven. Discreetly wants attention.

**Work Environment:** Environments balancing social interaction with quality standards; opportunities to lead team projects; settings allowing creative thinking AND structured execution; competitive with friendly rivalry; clear expectations with freedom to innovate

**Leadership Style:** Leads through combination of persuasion and planning. Involves people through explanation. Helps teams visualize steps and goals. Values teamwork but craves authority. Uses courtesy but is assertive when necessary. Encourages friendly competition. May become authoritarian when standards aren't maintained.

**Stress Triggers:** Failure or "loss"; others' disapproval; looking bad; standards not maintained; extensive follow-through required. **Under stress:** Becomes restless, critical, impatient; may become authoritarian or caustic; verbal criticism increases; competitive drive intensifies.

**Motivation Drivers:** "Winning with flair! Victory!"; being successful and appearing accomplished; appreciation for victories; success with style; competitive recognition; accomplishing goals with team; clear expectations; attention and approval

**Decision-Making:** Blends intuitive I-style thinking with analytical C-style evaluation. Makes creative ideas serve practical purposes. Develops detailed action plans. Prefers orderly, step-by-step progress. Can be decisive but may waver between gut instinct and analytical assessment.

**Conflict Style:** Competitive — wants to "win." Uses persuasion first but can become authoritarian. May become caustic in criticism. Lacks empathy when expressing disapproval (growth area). When C-side dominates: may comply rather than confront. When I-side dominates: tries to communicate and influence.

**Key Distinction from other I patterns:** The Appraiser is the only I-family pattern with analytical/quality-focused secondary dimension, creating unique internal tension. Unlike the Promoter (pure social), Persuader (social + driven), or Counselor (social + patient), the Appraiser combines social skills with critical thinking and quality standards, producing the most variable and situationally adaptive behavior in the I family.

## STEADINESS FAMILY (High S Primary)

The four S-family patterns share patience, reliability, and preference for stable environments. They are accommodating, methodical, and relationship-conscious. The progression from Specialist through Investigator represents a shift from pure people-supporting steadiness toward increasingly task-driven, analytical, and independent behavior.

---

### Pattern 9 — Specialist (Pure S)

**DISC Combination:** S high (only dimension above midline); D, I, C all low

**Alternative Names:** Pure S, Steady, Stabilizer, Supporter, Dove

**Behavioral Description**

Specialists "wear well" with others. With their moderate, controlled stance and modest demeanor, they work effectively with many behavioral styles. They are considerate, patient, and always ready to help those they consider friends. They build close relationships with a relatively small group of associates in the work environment, directing efforts toward **retaining familiar and predictable patterns**.

Most effective in specialized areas, Specialists plan their work along directed channels and achieve a **remarkably consistent performance**. Appreciation from others helps maintain that level of consistency. They seek to restore harmony to home and work, minimize conflict, and create calm, safe environments. They are friendly, compassionate people who listen with empathy and build deep relationships.

Their emotions are "calculatingly moderate" — they accommodate others. Specialists prefer practical, tried-and-true procedures ensuring stability. They prefer working behind the scenes and offering support rather than leading. As a pure style, the Specialist is not tempered by any secondary dimension — their steadiness is undiluted and their resistance to change is the strongest of any pattern.

**Core Strengths:** Loyal, precise, dependable, methodical; excels in detailed work; patient, reliable, conscientious; consistent performance over time; strong listening with empathy; deep meaningful relationships; accommodating and considerate; creates stable, harmonious environments; remarkably consistent when appreciated

**Weaknesses and Blind Spots:** Overly cautious and resistant to change; struggles with assertiveness; passive resistance to innovation; slow to adapt; needs help starting new projects; puts finished projects aside for further revision; low risk-taking; difficulty saying "no"; may become demotivated if forced to change without reason

**Communication Style:** Prefers one-on-one over group settings. Answers when asked but prefers listening. Speaks calmly and amiably. Seeks trust during interactions. Explains things thoroughly. Indirect and non-confrontational. Signs of tension are subtle — may not speak up if offended.

**Work Environment:** Status quo maintained unless given clear reasons for change; predictable routines; credit and sincere appreciation for work; minimal work infringement on home life; identification with a group; minimal conflict; clearly defined expectations

**Leadership Style:** Authority based on experience and expertise. Comfortable maintaining routines. Prefers supportive/servant leadership. Leads by example through consistent performance. Works behind the scenes supporting others.

**Stress Triggers:** Sudden plan changes; unexpected uncertainties; being unrecognized; making reactive decisions; aggressively competitive environments; change, chaos, disorganization. **Under stress:** Capitulates to authority; thinks with the group; passive resistance; withdraws; internalizes.

**Motivation Drivers:** Controlled, stable environment; maintaining status quo; security and consistency; sincere appreciation; predictable routines; clear expectations; being valued for specialized competence

**Decision-Making:** Deliberate and methodical — needs time. Prefers proven approaches. Conservative. Requires clear information before deciding. Seeks consensus. Avoids decisions creating conflict.

**Conflict Style:** Avoids at almost all costs. Diffuses through calm, empathetic approaches. Values stability above resolution. May not speak up when offended. Lets things settle rather than engaging. May yield to end conflict, then hold resentment.

---

### Pattern 10 — Agent (S/I)

**DISC Combination:** S high (primary); I moderate-high (secondary); D and C low

**Alternative Names:** Si style, Supporter-Influencer, Warm Supporter

**Behavioral Description**

Agents are easygoing, relaxed, and go with the flow. Like the Counselor (I/S — their mirror image), they strive to maintain harmony and treat people with respect. A key distinction is that **Agents tend to think of others first, then themselves**. Their S (supportive) style is naturally empathetic, while the I (Influence) style adds enthusiasm.

Agents exude a kind and generous spirit. They love team settings and appreciate environments ensuring stability and fostering long-term relationships with minimal change. Their ability to use empathy without judgment easily attracts and maintains friendships.

Agents are attentive to both human relations and task aspects. Empathetic and supportive, they are known for their willing ear. They make people feel wanted and needed. Because they respond to others' needs, **people do not fear being rejected by Agents**. They offer friendship and willingly perform services for others. They have excellent potential for organizing and completing tasks. They naturally promote harmony and teamwork and are particularly good at doing for others what they find difficult to do for themselves.

Although concerned with fitting into the group, Agents have a fair degree of independence. While they generally avoid conflict, they are willing to mediate between others to restore harmony.

**Core Strengths:** Empathetic, supportive, excellent listeners; create harmony and promote teamwork; combine warmth (I) with reliability (S); excellent task-related skills alongside people skills; service-oriented; make people feel wanted; attract friendships through non-judgmental empathy; good mediators; effective at organizing and completing tasks

**Weaknesses and Blind Spots:** Fear of conflict is primary weakness; supportive approach may enable tolerance of bad situations rather than problem-solving; "low profile" perceived as lacking toughness; overuse of kindness and patience; difficulty saying "no"; lack of firmness and self-assertion; struggle recognizing own strengths; avoid necessary difficult conversations

**Communication Style:** Quiet, tactful, friendly, casual. Accept affection readily, reject aggression. Communicate with warmth and empathy. Use persuasion through information or key friendships. Prefer inclusive, respectful dialogue. Listen more than speak. Non-confrontational with indirect approaches.

**Work Environment:** Team-based with stability and long-term relationships; minimal change and conflict; cooperative, supportive atmosphere; roles focused on service and helping; clear procedures; opportunities for meaningful connections

**Leadership Style:** Leads through service and harmony-creation. Influences through empathy and friendship. Focuses on team cohesion and inclusion. Mediates conflicts. May struggle with tough, unpopular decisions. Supportive but may lack directness in accountability.

**Stress Triggers:** Conflict and dissension; aggressive individuals; forced confrontation; constant change; feeling excluded. **Under stress:** Becomes persuasive using information or friendships; retreats to low profile; enables rather than confronts.

**Motivation Drivers:** Group acceptance and belonging; harmonious relationships; being valued for service and empathy; stability and long-term connections; helping others succeed

**Decision-Making:** Considers impact on relationships and group harmony first. Prefers consensus. Takes time for all perspectives. May defer to others to avoid conflict. Uses emotional intelligence. Can be influenced by key friendships.

**Conflict Style:** Strongly avoids direct confrontation but willing to mediate between others. Uses empathy and gentle persuasion. May enable problems by not addressing directly. Adopts "low profile" with aggressive individuals. Under pressure, uses key friendships as leverage.

**Key Distinction from Counselor (I/S):** The Agent leads with S (steadiness, support, stability) while the Counselor leads with I (influence, warmth, persuasion). Agents think of others first more naturally; Counselors are more socially proactive. The Agent is more task-capable and grounded; the Counselor is more socially expressive and emotionally available.

### Pattern 11 — Achiever (S/D)

**DISC Combination:** S high (primary); D moderate-high (secondary); I and C low

**Alternative Names:** SD or DS style. Note: Along with the Appraiser (I/C), this is one of two "opposite-style" classical patterns where the high dimensions are theoretically opposite.

**Behavioral Description**

Achievers have a strong sense of personal accountability and are confident of their work accomplishments. They may be reluctant to delegate when stressed. They thrive with a strong sense of direction and are continually pursuing new accomplishments. The dual S/D style makes it **difficult to predict their reactions** — sometimes in D mode (direct, results-oriented), other times in S mode (caring, accommodating).

They are highly independent yet may want to be part of a high-performing team. They express **fierce loyalty** to people in their lives. While their D nature focuses on results, their S nature cares about fairness and respect. This makes them natural champions of **equality and justice** — with S-compassion and D-tenacity, they willingly speak up for those unable to speak for themselves.

Their motivation is largely internal, flowing from deeply felt personal goals. Their commitment to personal goals precludes automatic acceptance of group goals — they need to see how their goals blend with organizational objectives. They demonstrate keen interest in work and intense, continual pursuit of accomplishment. Under pressure, they hesitate to delegate, taking work on themselves. Their guiding premise: **"If I succeed, I want the credit, and if I fail, I will take the blame."**

They function at peak efficiency and expect recognition equal to their contribution.

**Core Strengths:** Strong personal accountability; combines patience (S) with drive (D) for unwavering determination; champions fairness, equality, and justice; fierce loyalty; methodical yet persistent; completes tasks effectively; speaks up for the underdog; functions at peak efficiency; switches between caring and direct as needed

**Weaknesses and Blind Spots:** Reluctant to delegate; "either/or" thinking; overuses task focus and self-reliance; tunnel vision from task absorption; frustrated and impatient under pressure; difficulty compromising short-term for long-range benefits; unpredictable reactions due to S/D tension; takes back delegated tasks; demands recognition equal to contribution

**Communication Style:** In D mode: direct, assertive, results-focused. In S mode: patient, empathetic, accommodating. Style can shift unpredictably. Values clear, results-oriented discussion balanced with fairness. More willing to speak up than other S-types, especially for causes they believe in.

**Work Environment:** Strong direction and control over work; opportunities for personal accomplishment; recognition equal to contribution; clear task priorities; ability to work independently; part of high-performing teams with competent colleagues; environments valuing both results and fairness

**Leadership Style:** Leads by personal example and accountability. Champions equality and justice. Can be directive (D) or supportive (S) depending on situation. Expects high standards. Reluctant to delegate. Strong personal responsibility for outcomes. May struggle fully empowering others.

**Stress Triggers:** Competing or inferior work standards; inability to control work direction; forced delegation to untrusted people; lack of recognition; compromised quality. **Under stress:** Frustrated and impatient; becomes more of a "doer" and less of a "delegator"; takes on more work personally; shows D-mode behavior more prominently.

**Motivation Drivers:** Personal accomplishments; internal goals and deeply felt ambitions; recognition equal to contribution; control over work direction; fighting for fairness and justice; high-performing, competent teams

**Decision-Making:** Internally motivated based on personal goals. Blends methodical S with decisive D. Quick to take personal accountability. May default to "I'll do it myself." "Either/or" thinking can limit alternatives.

**Conflict Style:** More willing to engage than other S-types due to D influence. Speaks up assertively for fairness and justice. Champions the underdog. May oscillate between D-mode (confrontational) and S-mode (accommodating). Unpredictable responses due to dual-nature tension.

### Pattern 12 — Investigator (S/D/C)

**DISC Combination:** S high (primary); D and C both above midline (secondary); I is the only dimension below midline. Three-dimension pattern.

**Alternative Names:** SDC pattern, Analytical Achiever (informal)

**Behavioral Description**

Investigators are objective, analytical, and dispassionate **"anchors of reality."** Generally undemonstrative, they calmly and steadily pursue an independent path toward a fixed goal. They are successful at many things not because of versatility but due to **dogged determination to follow through**. They seek clear purpose or goals from which to develop orderly plans and organize actions.

Once a project begins, Investigators fight tenaciously to achieve objectives. Intervention is sometimes necessary to change their direction — they can be perceived as stubborn and opinionated. They value accomplishing things in a well-done fashion, assume heavy responsibility, and are attentive to important details. They have a keen ability to learn from experience and take corrective action.

They thrive on **challenging technical assignments** where they can use logic instead of emotion. When selling or marketing an idea, they are most successful with a concrete product. They are **not especially interested in pleasing people** and prefer to work alone. They can be perceived as cold, blunt, and tactless. They evaluate others by how they use facts and logic.

This is the most task-oriented and analytical of the four Steadiness patterns, with I (people/influence) as the only dimension below the midline. The combination of S patience, D drive, and C analytical precision creates a uniquely powerful task-completion engine.

**Core Strengths:** Dogged determination and tenacity; comprehensive task completion with detail attention; calm, steady pursuit of goals; strong analytical and logical thinking; thrives on technical challenges; learns from experience; assumes heavy responsibility; self-disciplined and methodical; combines patience (S) with drive (D) and precision (C)

**Weaknesses and Blind Spots:** Bluntness and suspicion/lack of trust; perceived as cold, blunt, tactless; not interested in pleasing people; stubborn — intervention needed to change direction; holds grudges; too distant and uninvolved; overly self-critical; reluctant to let others carry the load; needs greater understanding of others' emotions

**Communication Style:** Persistent, analytical, cautious, disciplined. Responds to logic rather than emotion. Prefers factual, data-driven discussions. Direct and sometimes blunt. Influences through personal tenacity rather than charm. May be terse or distant. Values factual, reliable information.

**Work Environment:** Challenging technical assignments; opportunities for data and logical analysis; ability to work alone or in small groups; clear goals for developing plans; formal roles with position authority; environments valuing quality and thoroughness; freedom from extensive social demands

**Leadership Style:** Leads through determination and personal example. Authority from formal roles and titles. Task-focused — drives toward fixed goals. Not a "people person" leader. Effective with technical teams. Expects factual, logical thinking. Can be perceived as stubborn and controlling.

**Stress Triggers:** Criticism in front of peers; excessive social involvement; selling abstract ideas; large group involvement; emotional environments; challenges to carefully developed plans. **Under stress:** Internalizes conflict; holds grudges; becomes more distant and blunt; more suspicious of others; retreats into solo work.

**Motivation Drivers:** Power through formal roles and position authority; accomplishing things well; challenging technical assignments; clear goals with organized plans; determined task focus being valued; working with factual, reliable data

**Decision-Making:** Highly analytical — uses data and facts to interpret information. Develops orderly plans. Once direction is set, pursues with single-minded determination. May be slow to change course even when evidence suggests adjustment. Evaluates others by use of factual information. Responds to logic over emotion.

**Conflict Style:** Internalizes rather than expressing openly. Holds grudges. Uses logic and facts when engaging. May become blunt and direct (D influence) when pushed. Doesn't seek people-pleasing resolution — wants the "correct" outcome. Prefers avoiding emotional confrontation. Distrustful of others' motives. If conflict persists, withdraws to work independently.

**Key Distinction from other S patterns:** The Investigator is the least people-oriented and most task-focused S pattern. Where the Specialist seeks harmony, the Agent seeks connection, and the Achiever seeks personal accomplishment, the Investigator seeks objective truth and systematic task completion through analytical determination.

## CONSCIENTIOUSNESS FAMILY (High C Primary)

The three C-family patterns share analytical thinking, precision, and quality focus. The progression from Objective Thinker through Practitioner adds increasing degrees of social awareness and warmth to the analytical core.

---

### Pattern 13 — Objective Thinker (Pure C)

**DISC Combination:** C high (only dimension above midline); D, I, S all low

**Alternative Names:** Pure C, Analyst, Evaluator

**Behavioral Description**

Objective Thinkers have highly developed critical thinking abilities. They emphasize the importance of facts when drawing conclusions and planning actions, seeking **correctness and accuracy in everything**. They continually question ideas and processes to ensure things are done properly. They are systematic, practical, and efficient.

To manage work effectively, they often combine intuitive information with gathered facts. When in doubt, they avoid public failure by **preparing meticulously** — mastering new skills privately before using them in group settings. They prefer working with people interested in maintaining a peaceful environment. Considered shy by some, they may be reticent in expressing feelings and are particularly uncomfortable with aggressive people.

Despite being mild-mannered, Objective Thinkers have a **strong need to control their environment**, exerting this control indirectly by requiring adherence to rules and standards. They make decisions based on logical analysis of observable, quantifiable information rather than emotions. They prefer working independently yet remain objective and diplomatic. They tend toward "analysis paralysis" — the classic **"Ready, Aim, Aim, Aim, Aim"** pattern where they never fire because they're still analyzing.

When they make mistakes, they hesitate to acknowledge them and instead search for information to support their position.

| Attribute | Description |
|---|---|
| **Emotions** | Rejects interpersonal aggression |
| **Goal** | Correctness |
| **Judges Others By** | Ability to think logically |
| **Influences Others By** | Use of facts, data, logical arguments |

**Communication Style:** Indirect and guarded — cautious and reflective. Prefers fact-based, logical exchanges. Reticent about personal feelings. Measures words carefully. Prefers written or well-prepared presentations. Avoids emotional language. Dislikes pressure for immediate responses.

**Work Environment:** Reserved, business-like atmosphere; clearly defined expectations; quality and accuracy valued; opportunities to demonstrate expertise; control over performance factors; opportunity to ask "why" questions; peaceful, aggression-free; independent work with minimal interruptions

**Leadership Style:** Leads through expertise and standards. Exerts control indirectly through rules and procedures. Values quality and competency above all. Ensures accuracy and avoids costly mistakes. May slow decision-making. Leads by example and mastery rather than charisma. May struggle providing emotional support.

**Stress Triggers:** Irrational behavior; ridicule or public criticism; ambiguity; aggressive interactions; rushed deadlines; decisions without sufficient data. **Under stress:** Worrisome and anxious; immerses in more analysis; withdraws socially; becomes rigid about rules; avoids acknowledging mistakes.

**Motivation Drivers:** Precision, accuracy, logical correctness; demonstrating expertise; recognition for specific skills; control over environment and quality; freedom to investigate; clearly defined expectations; peaceful, structured settings

**Decision-Making:** Highly analytical and data-driven. Bases decisions on logical analysis of quantifiable information. Avoids emotional influence. Concerned with finding the "right" answer. Struggles with ambiguity. Gets bogged down when uncertain. Prepares meticulously.

**Conflict Style:** Strongly avoids interpersonal aggression. Uses subtle, indirect approaches. Controls through rules rather than confrontation. Withdraws rather than engaging directly. Uses facts and data to resolve disagreements. Uncomfortable with aggressive people. May search for supporting data rather than admitting error.

### Pattern 14 — Perfectionist (C/S)

**DISC Combination:** C high (primary); S moderate-high (secondary); D and I low

**Alternative Names:** CS style, The Analyst (some providers)

**Behavioral Description**

"If it can't be done right, then why do it at all" — the Perfectionist's mantra. C/S styles are driven by a need for accuracy and logic. The C provides precision while the S adds patience, resulting in an individual with **intense quality focus**. They are systematic, precise thinkers who follow procedures in both personal and professional life.

Extremely conscientious, they are diligent with work requiring detail and accuracy. Because they desire stable conditions and predictable activities, they are most comfortable in **clearly defined work environments** with specifics on expectations, time requirements, and evaluation procedures. They employ plans and procedures to avoid the unexpected, exercise due diligence for detailed accuracy, and question assumptions requiring extensive information before decisions.

They may bog down in decision-making details and be criticized for the time taken to gather and analyze information. They evaluate themselves and others by **precise standards** for achieving concrete results while adhering to standard operating procedures. They may define their worth too much by what they do rather than who they are — reacting to compliments with skepticism ("What does this person want?").

| Attribute | Description |
|---|---|
| **Emotions** | Displays competence; restrained and cautious |
| **Goal** | Stability; predictable accomplishments |
| **Judges Others By** | Precise standards |
| **Influences Others By** | Attention to detail; accuracy |

**Weaknesses and Blind Spots:** Defines self-worth by accomplishments; overly dependent on past procedures; slow decision-making; resistant to change and innovation; perfectionist nature causes stress and anxiety; may be late delivering due to unrealistic standards; controlling — finds something wrong in others' work; suspicious of compliments; needs more role flexibility and self-worth belief; risk-averse

**Communication Style:** Reserved, deliberate, measured. Displays competence and restraint. Non-demonstrative. Prefers logical, fact-based discussions. More warm than pure C due to S influence but still guarded. May internalize concerns. Prefers written or structured formats. Their silence doesn't mean everything is fine.

**Work Environment:** Clearly defined expectations with specific time requirements and evaluation procedures; stable, predictable conditions; quality-focused atmosphere; established procedures; structured roles; behind-the-scenes rather than spotlight; minimal conflict and antagonism; stability with minimal chaos

**Leadership Style:** Servant leader mindset — fair-minded and appreciative of different strengths. Humble. Prioritizes reliability and quality. Aims to lessen uncertainty for team. Enjoys supporting people to do their best work. Patient and methodical. Creates stable, quality-focused environments. May struggle with rapid change and conflict management.

**Stress Triggers:** Hostile or antagonistic environments; unpredictable situations; criticism of work; chaos; loss of security; conflict; rapid change; ambiguous expectations. **Under stress:** Becomes tactful and diplomatic (withdraws into safety); resorts to familiar procedures; becomes inflexible; appeals to conventional methods; resists change; may freeze or become passive; passive-aggressive tactics possible.

**Motivation Drivers:** Predictable and stable outcomes; quality results through established methods; maintaining high standards; appreciation for thoroughness; clear expectations and structured evaluation; secure, stable environments; adequate time to plan and verify

**Decision-Making:** Methodical and thorough. Gathers extensive information. Questions assumptions and analyzes alternatives. May be criticized for time taken. Requires extensive data.

### Pattern 15 — Practitioner (C/I/S)

**DISC Combination:** C high (primary); I and S both above midline (secondary); D is the only dimension below midline. Three-dimension pattern.

**Alternative Names:** CIS pattern; described as "Curious, Social, Cooperative"

**Behavioral Description**

Practitioners value **proficiency in specialized areas**. Spurred by a desire to be "good at something," they carefully monitor their own work performance. Although their aim is to be "the" expert in an area, they frequently give the impression of knowing something about everything — an image strengthened when they verbalize knowledge on many subjects.

As they interact, they project a **relaxed, diplomatic, and easygoing style** (I and S influence). This congenial attitude may change quickly in their own work area when they become intensely focused on meeting high performance standards. Because they value self-discipline, they evaluate others on ability to focus on daily performance. They have high expectations and **tend to verbalize their disappointment** when standards aren't met.

Practitioners enjoy being team members and helping others succeed. They **prefer a supportive role and would rather not lead**. They don't want accountability for major decisions or risk-taking. When given plenty of time to think, they bring valuable insights. Their reluctance to move fast can frustrate others.

They prefer comfortable, cooperative environments with trusting, pleasant people. They thrive contributing to detail-oriented projects. They are uniquely skilled in **both technical and people problem-solving** — the only C-family pattern combining analytical precision with social awareness and patience.

| Attribute | Description |
|---|---|
| **Emotions** | Wants to keep up in effort and technical performance |
| **Goal** | Personal growth |
| **Judges Others By** | Self-discipline; position and promotions |
| **Influences Others By** | Confidence in mastering new skills; developing "proper" procedures |
| **Value to Organization** | Skilled in technical AND people problem-solving; proficiency and specialization |
| **Overuses** | Personal objectives; unrealistic expectations of others |
| **Under Pressure** | Becomes restrained; sensitive to criticism |
| **Fears** | Predictability; no recognition as "expert" |

**Core Strengths:** Skilled in both technical and people problem-solving (unique among C-family); displays proficiency and specialization; relaxed, diplomatic, easygoing style; patient and cooperative team member; combines analytical precision with social awareness; strong verbal skills; accommodating and inspiring; effective at developing organized approaches; loyal, supportive team player; courteous and diplomatic

**Weaknesses and Blind Spots:** Overattention to personal objectives at expense of team goals; unrealistic expectations of others; reluctance to lead or take accountability for major decisions; risk-averse; reluctance to move fast frustrates colleagues; overly sensitive to criticism under pressure; becomes restrained when stressed; verbalizes disappointment judgmentally; may give impression of knowing everything (can seem pretentious); needs to delegate more effectively

**Communication Style:** Relaxed, diplomatic, easygoing in social interactions (most sociable of C-family). Pleasant, courteous, restrained. Verbalizes knowledge confidently on many subjects. Shifts from congenial to intensely focused within work domain. Diplomatic and tactful with indirect approaches. More warm and accepting than Objective Thinker or Perfectionist. Will verbalize disappointment when standards aren't met.

**Work Environment:** Comfortable and cooperative atmosphere; trusting, pleasant people; detail-oriented projects; opportunities for specialized expertise; recognition as expert; supportive (not leadership) roles; structured with clear procedures; team-oriented; environments valuing self-discipline and quality; stability mixed with enough variety to avoid predictability

**Leadership Style:** Prefers NOT to lead — favors supportive, collaborative roles. When leading, acts as subject-matter expert and mentor. Influences through skill demonstration and proper procedures. Sets high expectations and monitors performance. More people-aware than other C-family leaders. Needs to delegate rather than handling everything personally. Should take more risks.

**Stress Triggers:** Risk-taking situations; being seen as too predictable or ordinary; not being recognized as expert; criticism (especially public); forced leadership or major decision-making; undisciplined colleagues; chaos. **Under stress:** Becomes restrained and withdrawn; overly sensitive to criticism; voices disapproval more sharply; puts personal objectives first; retreats to area of expertise; becomes rigid about procedures.

**Motivation Drivers:** Personal growth and skill development; becoming recognized as "the expert"; supporting and interacting with others on meaningful projects; mastering new skills; advancing in position and knowledge; contributing to team success; being valued for proficiency; cooperative, pleasant environment

**Decision-Making:** Prefers not to make major decisions or take risks. Needs ample time to think. Brings valuable insights when given time. Bases decisions on expertise and procedures. More cautious than fast. Comfortable within area of expertise. Combines analytical thinking with people-impact consideration (I and S).

**Conflict Style:** Diplomatic and accommodating — prefers harmony (S and I influence). Values cooperative environments. Verbalizes disapproval when expectations unmet (may seem passive-aggressive). Becomes restrained and sensitive under pressure. Resolves through proper procedures. More comfortable addressing indirectly. Uses social skills (I) to smooth over. Patient enough (S) to wait for resolution. May withdraw rather than escalate.

**Key Distinction from other C patterns:** The Practitioner is the most people-oriented C pattern. The Objective Thinker is the pure analytical engine. The Perfectionist adds stability and quality control. The Practitioner adds both social warmth and patience, creating the only C pattern that is genuinely comfortable in team settings and skilled at interpersonal problem-solving alongside technical work.

## Cross-pattern differentiation guide for application logic

Understanding how similar patterns differ is critical for accurate assessment classification. Here are the most commonly confused pattern pairs and their distinguishing characteristics:

**Developer vs. Results-Oriented:** Both lead with D, but the Results-Oriented uses the I secondary as social leverage for driving results. The Developer is more purely self-reliant and independent. Look for social awareness in service of achievement (Results-Oriented) versus pure self-directed problem-solving (Developer).

**Results-Oriented vs. Inspirational:** Both are D/I combinations. The key differentiator is the **relative distance between D and I scores**. When D clearly dominates I, the pattern is Results-Oriented (uses force of character). When D and I are nearly equal, the pattern is Inspirational (uses persuasion and coalition-building). The Inspirational pattern is more socially strategic.

**Promoter vs. Persuader:** Both lead with I, but the Persuader adds D-driven purposefulness. Promoters socialize for connection itself; Persuaders socialize with ambition and results in mind. The Persuader is more assertive, impulsive, and outcomes-focused.

**Counselor vs. Agent:** These are mirror patterns — Counselor is I/S (leads with influence), Agent is S/I (leads with steadiness). Counselors are more socially proactive and expressive; Agents are more grounded, task-capable, and think of others first more naturally.

**Achiever vs. Investigator:** Both are S-primary with D secondary, but the Investigator adds C (analytical precision). The Achiever is driven by personal accountability and justice; the Investigator is driven by analytical determination and technical mastery. The Investigator is the most task-oriented S pattern and least interested in pleasing people.

**Objective Thinker vs. Perfectionist:** Both lead with C, but the Perfectionist adds S (patience, stability-seeking). The Objective Thinker explores novel analytical approaches independently; the Perfectionist clings to established procedures and "fail-safe" controls. The Perfectionist is more stability-dependent and procedure-oriented.

**Perfectionist vs. Practitioner:** Both include C and S, but the Practitioner adds I (social awareness). The Perfectionist works behind the scenes and controls quality; the Practitioner engages with teams, verbalizes knowledge, and is the most socially comfortable C pattern. The Practitioner fears being seen as "too predictable" while the Perfectionist fears antagonism.

## Implementation notes for assessment application

The pattern identification algorithm should follow this logic based on which dimensions score above the midline threshold:

1. Count dimensions above midline
2. For single-dimension patterns, assign the corresponding pure style (Developer/Promoter/Specialist/Objective Thinker)
3. For two-dimension patterns, identify primary (highest) and secondary, then map to the appropriate pattern
4. For the D/I combination specifically, calculate the gap between D and I — if the gap is small (within a defined threshold), classify as Inspirational; if D clearly dominates, classify as Results-Oriented
5. For three-dimension patterns (only two exist): S+D+C = Investigator; C+I+S = Practitioner
6. The four-digit segment number system (each dimension scored 1–7) provides **2,041 possible combinations** that map to these 15 patterns

Validation benchmarks from Wiley research: target **median alpha ≥ .87** for internal consistency, **test-retest ≥ .86**, and **≥ 90% narrative agreement** rate where users confirm their pattern description matches their self-perception.
